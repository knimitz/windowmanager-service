= Example Application for TMC AGL WindowManager Client Lib 
This is a example QML application that uses clients of the TMC WindowManager.

== Dependencies
* Qt5 + QtQuick (QML) with ivi-shell support

== Build instructions
Inside of an SDK environment run:

----------------
qmake
make
----------------

* The binary should be installed somewhere in $PATH

== Usage
Run this application like follows:

----------------
qmlWindowManagerSampleApp $width $height $appLabel $colorName
----------------

.Note
****************
Depending on your environment you will need to set the following
environment variable to instruct Qt to use the ivi-shell integration:
`QT_WAYLAND_SHELL_INTEGRATION=ivi-shell`
****************

Starts the application with a surface the size $width x $height
the Surface will request the label "$appLabel" and set its surface
color "$colorName" e.g. red.

Note, that although the application sets an initial window size, the
window manager will send events to the application that instruct it to
set the proper, requested size for the layout.
